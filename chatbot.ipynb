For countries with special requirements, an invoice can be ordered using forms that are available for this purpose.\\n\\nUsing an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice\\nYour e-ticket confirmation is internationally recognised as a receipt in most countries, including Switzerland, and it can be used for the reimbursement of expenses and for the submission of a tax return.\\n\\nYou can order your e-ticket confirmation in your profile under “Bookings” via the link “E-documents (Invoice)” or via the link “\\u200bPassenger Receipt”.\\n\\nOrdering an invoice after your booking\\nIf you find out at a later date that you require an invoice, we can send you a new booking confirmation free of charge up to 90 days after the ticket/document has been completely used. After this 90-day period, we charge a fee of CHF 30 for each confirmation (up to a maximum of five e-ticket confirmations).\\n\\nInvoices for Greece, India, Italy or Spain\\nFor flights originating in Greece, India, Italy or Spain, we can issue special invoices on request. You can request an invoice in these countries if the information provided on your e-ticket is not deemed sufficient.\\n\\n\\n## Credit Cards\\n\\nCard Security Number\\n \\n\\nTo make your payments with credit or debit cards online even more secure, we require you to enter the card security number for online bookings. This code will check the validity of the credit/debit card information.\\n\\n \\n\\nAmerican Express\\n\\nIf you are using an American Express Card the security number is the 4 digit number shown above the credit card number on the front of the card.\\n\\nMasterCard\\n\\nIf you are using a Mastercard (credit card or debit card) the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\\n\\nVisa\\n\\nIf you are using a Visa card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\\n\\nDiners\\n\\nIf you are using a Diners card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\\n\\nJBC\\n\\nIf you are using a JCB card the security number is a 3 digit number on the reverse side of your card where the signature appears.\\n\\nChina Union Pay\\n\\nIf you use a China Union Pay credit card, you will find the 3-digit security number in the signature field on the back of your card.\\n\\n\\n## Card Security\\n\\nPayment security standards\\nBased on a new EU directive on payment services, we have increased our payment security standards, which ensures an even safer environment for online transactions across European countries.\\n\\nWe follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which defines the rules for how we store, transmit and process payment data, particularly with regard to credit and debit card transactions.

This additional step of authentication guarantees secure payments and reduces the risk of fraud.\\n\\nHow does the 3-D Secure process work?\\nIf you haven\\'t done so yet, you will have to register your credit and debit card for this process.\\n\\nRegister via the website of the bank which issued your credit or debit card. This process can vary from bank to bank.\\nTo complete your transaction, you will be redirected to the bank\\'s website for this additional authentication, if 3-D Secure applies to your payment.\\nFalls Sie weitere Fragen zur Registrierung Ihrer Karten für 3-D Secure haben, wenden Sie sich bitte direkt an Ihre Bank.\\nIf you have any further questions about the registration of your cards for 3-D Secure, please contact your bank or card issuing company directly.\\n\\n\\n## Pay per invoice\\nWho can use \"Pay per invoice\"?\\nYou must be over 18 years old and be a resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein.

You can find more detailed information about these reasons on the \\u200bPOWERPAY website.\\n\\nHow and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?\\nInvoices are issued by POWERPAY. You will receive an individual invoice by e-mail after about 24–48 hours. This invoice is issued free of charge. When the individual invoice is paid on time, no charges are incurred. After this, the amounts outstanding from the individual invoices you have already received will be summarised into one account statement.

You can decide to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.\\n\\nWhen does a reminder fee become due and how much does it cost?\\nIf the minimum payment of the monthly invoice is made late, POWERPAY charges a reminder fee of CHF 15 for the first reminder and CHF 25 for the second reminder.\\n\\nHow do I get a refund if I cancel my ticket?\\nThis depends on when you make the cancellation.\\n\\nIf the invoice has already been paid, you will receive the corresponding refund by bank transfer.\\nIf SWISS is able to inform POWERPAY of the cancellation before the end of the payment period and if the invoice has not been paid or has only been partially paid, POWERPAY will send you a new individual invoice with the new amount and the new payment period if there is still an amount pending.\\nIf SWISS is only able to inform POWERPAY once the end of the payment period has been reached, and if the invoice has not been paid or only partially paid, the MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with the additional costs of CHF 2.90 minus the amount to be refunded.\\n \\n\\nDo I have to pay the invoice in full before boarding my flight?\\nNo, you can board your flight regardless of whether you have paid your POWERPAY invoice or not.\\n\\nDo you have any queries about your invoice?\\nIf you have any queries about invoices, please contact POWERPAY’s customer service.\\n\\nE-mail: info@powerpay.ch\\n\\nHotline: +41 58 806 06 22\\n\\nCustomer service is available Mondays to Fridays from 8:00 to 17:00 h.\\n\\nCan I give my business address for payments?\\nPurchases on account can only be made on submission of your private address.\\n\\n\\n## Frequently asked questions: Payment\\nWhat advantages do I have if I used the currency conversion option?\\nUsing the currency conversion option gives you the following advantages:\\n\\nYou decide which currency is to be charged to your credit card.\\nThe daily exchange rate is displayed, and is guaranteed for the payment.\\nCredit card companies usually charge an additional fee for purchases in foreign currencies (foreign currency fee). This does not apply if you pay in the currency of your credit card.\\n \\n\\nWho can benefit from the currency conversion option?\\nThe option to pay in a different currency is available only when booking through swiss.com.\\n\\nThe service cannot be used to change flights, for later upgrades or additional services (e.g. additional baggage item etc.) or for ticket purchases made through different booking channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.\\n\\nWhat exchange rate is used for the conversion?\\nThe total converted amount is based on the daily exchange rates of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). Please note that the exchange range can therefore vary for new bookings or booking enquiries made through swiss.com.\\n\\nThe exchange rate at the time the booking is concluded is definitive. It will appear both on swiss.com and on the confirmation.\\n\\nWill there be any other credit card charges?\\nSome banks might charge additional fees in individual cases. SWISS has no influence over these charges.\\n\\nWhat currency is used for refunds?\\nRückerstattungen finden immer in der Währung des ausgestellten Tickets statt.\\n\\n\\n## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\\nNo. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\\n\\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\\n\\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\\n\\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\\n\\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\\n\\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\\n\\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\\n\\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\\n\\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\\n\\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\\n\\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\\n\\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\\n\\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\\nApplies to \"Economy Flex\" and \"Business Flex\" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport.
